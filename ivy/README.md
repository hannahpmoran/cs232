# Ivy

Ivy was my final project for CS 232: Art, Interactivity, and Microcontrollers. 

Ivy is a sculpture of a robot. Specifically, the head of a robot. Crafted out of the skeleton of an old schoolroom projector, Ivy was constructed to appear ancient yet futuristic. 

I wanted to create the experience of a human interacting with a robot on the street, in passing, which fit well because she was interacted with during an art show. Ivy ended up being a fortune teller, destined to give the humans who pass insight into their future. 

Ivy's external appearance was solidified with the use of an LCD face. Typically, these screens displayed text, but Ivy's depicted facial animation using certain textual characters. 

The dialogue was generated using a text generator, and her voice was generated using an online voice generator tool.
